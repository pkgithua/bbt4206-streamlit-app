For example:

Data Visualization and Storytelling Tools – Hands-on training with tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker to help students communicate insights effectively.

Big Data Analytics – Understanding how to process and analyze large-scale datasets using modern platforms like Hadoop or Spark.

Machine Learning for Business Insights – Introducing predictive analytics, classification models, and AI integration for real-world business forecasting.

Cloud-Based BI Solutions – Exposure to BI tools on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to understand how organizations are migrating analytics to the cloud.

Data Governance and Ethics – Discussing data privacy, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and responsible use of business data.","In my opinion, some of the basic theoretical or overly introductory topics could be reduced or removed from the Business Intelligence I and II curriculum to make room for more practical, hands-on learning. For example, the extended coverage of traditional database concepts (like basic SQL operations or data warehousing theory) could be shortened, since these are usually covered in earlier courses.","1.I liked how the course combined both theoretical and practical aspects of Business Intelligence, allowing me to understand concepts and then apply them in real-world scenarios.
